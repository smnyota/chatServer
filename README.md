Chat Room!

Creative Portion:

Broadcasting Feature: When a user either enters or exits a room a custom message associated with their username is broadcasted to everyone currently in the room. There are currently 4 custom messges: one for when a user joins the room (" has joined the room"), a second for when a user clicks the leave button (" has left the room"), a third for when a user is kicked from a room: " has been temporarily kicked from the room", and a fourth for when a user is permanently banned from a room (" has been permanetly banned from the room")

Custom Backgrounds: When creating a room, you input a room background color which will correspond to the background color for all users when joining that specific room!

Room Deletion: The creator of each room has an option to delete the room inside the chatroom. This will kick out all users by removing them from the room with a custom message and delete all information associated with the room.

Users have the ability to private message themseles and creators of the room can kick and permanently ban themselves.
